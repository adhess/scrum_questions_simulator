### Q'144 You have six teams using a traditional method to deliver a product. Your management has asked you to start using Scrum. In the initial project there were separate plans and teams for the layers of a software system, i.e. one for the front-end, one for the middle tier, one for the back-end, and one for the interfaces and services. This resembles what is known as component teams. But you have read that it’s a good idea to have teams organized by feature.What are the advantages of keeping component teams while starting Scrum?

### Q'148 Select two ways in which technical debt impacts transparency. (Choose two.)
- [ ] When calculated and estimated, the total amount of technical debt shows exactly how long until the Product Owner can release the Increment.
- [x] It leads to false assumptions about the current state of the system, specifically of an Increment being releasable at the end of a Sprint.
- [x] As development progresses and code is added, the system becomes more difficult to stabilize, which results in future work being slowed down in unpredictable ways.
- [ ] It enhances transparency for the Product Owner as a Development Team is not allowed to do additional feature development in a Sprint as long as there is technical debt.

### Q'149 Marian is the Product Owner envisioning a project for a new release of her product. She made a projection of a release date based upon a sustained velocity of 17 completed units of work per Sprint. Over the first 3 Sprints, the average velocity was 13 for work that the Development Team estimated as 90% done. The Development Teams, feeling the need to meet the plan, figured that a velocity of 17 was within their reach.A good way to continue is:
- [x] The Development Team makes sure that all of the selected scope per Sprint is as “Done” as possible. The undone work is estimated and added to the Sprint Backlog of the next Sprint, so it doesn’t mess up the Product Backlog.
- [ ] Add enough people to the Development Team for the deadline to be made.
- [ ] The opportunity to inspect and adapt is lost. Opaqueness has replaced transparency. Predictability has dropped below zero. The produced software is not usable. As the rules of Scrum have not been respected, it is the Scrum Master’s duty to assess whether repair is possible, or a restart with a more reliable team. If not, the Scrum Master should cancel the project.

### Q'161 Which of the following are true about the length of the Sprint? (Choose two.)
- [ ] The length of the Sprint should be proportional to the work that is done in between Sprints.
- [x] It is best to have Sprints of consistent length throughout a development effort.
- [ ] Sprint length is determined during Sprint Planning, and should hold the time it will take to code the planned features in the upcoming Sprint, but does not include time for any testing.
- [ ] Sprint length is determined during Sprint Planning, and should be long enough to make sure the Development Team can deliver what is to be accomplished in the upcoming Sprint.
- [x] All Sprints must be 1 month or less.

- [ ] Analyze, describe, and document the requirements for the subsequent Sprints.

- [x] Create an increment of potentially releasable software.

### Q'163 In the Sprint Planning meeting, the Product Owner and the Development Team were unable to reach a clear understanding about the highest order Product Backlog items. Because of this, the Development Team couldn’t figure out how many Product Backlog items it could forecast for the upcoming Sprint. They were able to agree on a Sprint Goal, however.Which of the following two actions should the Scrum Master support? (Choose two.)
- [ ] Cancel the Sprint. Send the entire team to an advanced Scrum training and then start a new Sprint.
- [x] Forecast the most likely Product Backlog items to meet the goal and create a Sprint Backlog based on a likely initial design and plan.

This resembles what is known as component teams. But you have read that it’s a good idea to have teams organized by feature.What are the advantages of keeping component teams while starting Scrum?
